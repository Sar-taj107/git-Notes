# git-Notes‚ö°Ô∏è‚ú®
This repository can be used for mastering Git and efficiently managing version control in software development projects. It serves as a knowledge base for Git enthusiasts, helping them remember essential Git commands, best practices, and solutions to common Git-related challenges.

## What is Version Controlüî• ?

A version control system is just a software that helps you manage different versions of your project.
When you use version control, you create safe points that save your project, giving you total freedom and security to change anything about your project, and not worry about losing any of your data.

The main point of a VCS is to help us maintain a detailed history of the project, and to work onn different versions of it too.

A Source Code Manager(SCM) is another name for a version control system.

## Types of Version Control System ModelsüöÄ

1. * Centralised : A central computer hosts all the projects, and all the interactions should happen through it.
2. * Distributed : There's no such central repository, each developer has a complete copy of the project on their system.

## Most Popular Version Control Systems üöÄ

1. git
2. Subversion
3. Mercurial

## Git vs GithubüöÄ :

Git is a distributed version control system. Git and Github are different from each other. Git is a version control tool while Github is a service that hosts git projects.

## git- Key Terms‚ú®

### 1. Version control system (VCS)- 

A VCS allows you to revert a file/project to a previous state, to see who made the changes and when or who introduced an issue etc.

## 1. Git init
The command is used to initialise a local repo as git repo.
``` git init```
## 2. Git clone
To clone a repo :
``` git clone <URL>```
To clone a repo in a directory with a different name
``` git clone <URL> dir-name ```
At this point of time, you must be having a Git repo on your local machine, and a checkout/ working-copy of all the files.<br>
So now, you make changes.<br>
And at any point you wish to record the state of the project, you <b>commit the snapshot of those changes</b><br>
<br>

###  States of a File‚ú® :
1. <b>Tracked</b> - the files that  Git knows about, can be modified, unmodified or staged.
2. <b>Untracked</b> - any file that wasn't present in your last snapshot.
Note : Initially, all files are tracked and unmodified.Once you make changes to any file, Git marks them as modified (since it has changed in comparison to the last commit), and then as you work, you selectively stage the modified files and commit the staged changes. And the cycle repeats !<br>
Untracked  -> Staged (Add the file)<br>
Unmodified -> Modified (Edit the file)<br>
Modified -> Staged (Stage the file )<br>
Staged -> Unmodified (Committed the file)<br>
Unmodified -> Untracked (removed the file)<br>
## 3. Git Status
The git status command is used to display the current state of your Git repository. When you run this command, Git will show you information about:
* Changes that are not yet staged for commit (unstaged changes).
* Changes that are staged for commit but not yet committed.
* Untracked files in your working directory.
  
used  to determine which files are in which state.

```
git status 
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
nothing to commit, working directory clean
```
Means -
1. Tells that you are on the branch master.
2. Informs that the the branch has not diverged from the same branch on the server.
3. Clean working directory - meaning by that none of the tracked files have been modified.
4. If it shows "Changes to be committed:" then it means that the following files have been staged.
5. If it shows "Changes not staged for commit :" means that a file that is tracked has been modified in the working directory but not yet staged. To stage it, you run the ```git add``` command.
5. If it shows "Untracked files", then you can track/stage it using ```git add```.
## 4. Git add
used to track new files.
``` git add  <file-name>```
Once you run ```git add``` on a file, it gets tracked and staged.
Basically, ``` git add``` is a multipurpose command, you use it to begin tracking new files, to stage files, and to do other things like marking merge-conflicted files as resolved. It may be helpful to think of it more as ‚Äúadd precisely this content to the next commit‚Äù rather than ‚Äúadd this file to the project‚Äù.
Note : Git stages a file exactly as it is when you run the git add command. So, If you modify a file after you run git add, you have to run git add again to stage the latest version of the file.
Suppose, you modified a file after running git add, and do ```git status```, the file name will be shown both under the staged section, as well as the unstaged section. And in case you do, ```git commit``` from here , the state of the file on that previous git add gets committed , and not the current state.
So, to get the current state of the file to get committed, you must run  ``` git add ``` again.

## 5. Git commit
- The git commit command is used to save the changes you've made to your local repository. Each commit represents a specific set of changes, and you can attach a commit message to describe what those changes are. Here's how you can use git commit:

- Stage Changes: Before committing, you need to stage the changes you want to include in the commit. Use the git add command to stage files.
- For example:
  ```
    git add file1.txt   # Stage specific files
  ```
  - You can also use git add . to stage all changes in the current directory.
  - Commit Changes: Once you've staged your changes, you're ready to commit them. Use the git commit command with the -m flag to include a commit message. For example:
  ```
    git commit -m "Add new feature"
  ```
  - Replace "Add new feature" with a concise and descriptive message about what the commit does.

## 6. Git log
- The git log command is used to display a list of commits in the repository's commit history. It provides information about each commit, such as the commit message, author, date, and a unique SHA-1 hash. Here's how you can use git log:
  ```
    git log
  ```
- By running this command, you'll see a list of commits in the following format:
  ```
    commit <commit-hash>
    Author: <author-name>
    Date: <commit-date>
    <commit-message>
  ```

## 7. Git push
To push your local Git changes to a remote repository (like GitHub), you can use the git push command. Here are the basic steps to push your changes:

* First, make sure you're in the root directory of your Git repository in the terminal or command prompt.
* Use the following command to push your changes:
  ```
    git push origin branch-name
  ```
* Replace origin with the name of the remote repository you want to push to (usually, this is "origin" by default when you clone a 
  repository).
* Replace branch-name with the name of the branch you want to push. The default branch is usually "main" or "master."

  For example, if you want to push your changes to the default branch (e.g., "main"), you can use:
  ```
    git push origin main
  ```
* If you're pushing to a branch for the first time or creating a new branch on the remote repository, you may need to set the upstream branch with:
  ```
    git push -u origin branch-name
  ```
* The -u flag stands for "upstream," and it sets up a tracking relationship between your local branch and the remote branch.
## 8. Git pull
- The git pull command is used to fetch and merge changes from a remote repository into your local repository. It's a combination of two actions: git fetch and git merge. Here's how you can use it:
- Navigate to the local repository's root directory using your terminal or command prompt.
- Use the following command to pull changes from the remote repository:
  ```
    git pull origin branch-name
  ```
- Replace origin with the name of the remote repository you want to pull changes from (typically "origin").
- Replace branch-name with the name of the branch you want to pull changes from.
- For example, to pull changes from the "main" branch of the remote repository, you can use:
  ```
    git pull origin main
  ```
- If you want to update your current branch with the changes from the remote branch (a typical use case), you can use the following shorter command:
  ```
    git pull
  ```
- If there are any incoming changes, Git will fetch them from the remote repository and automatically merge them into your local branch. If there are merge conflicts, you will be prompted to resolve them.
## 9. Git revert
- The git revert command is used to create a new commit that undoes the changes made in a previous commit. It is a safe way to reverse changes without altering the commit history. Here's how to use git revert:
  ```
    git revert <commit-hash>
  ```
- `<commit-hash>`: Replace this with the hash of the commit you want to revert. You can find the commit hash by using the git log command.
   When you run git revert, Git will create a new commit that contains the opposite changes of the specified commit. This means that the 
   changes introduced in the specified commit will be removed, effectively "reverting" the code to the state it was in before that commit 
   was made.
## 10. Git ignore 
For files such as log files, or build system files that you don't want Git to add or show them as untracked, you can ask Git to ignore them using the ```.gitignore``` file. 
``` 
cat .gitignore
*.[oa]
*~
node_modules/
```
Here, the first line archives all the files ending with ```.o``` or ```.a```.<br>
The second line archives all the files ending with ```.~```.<br>
The third line archives the entire directory called node_modules.<br>
Note : Always set up a ```.gitignore``` file for a new project, before you get going so that you don't accidently commit any such files.
## 11. Git diff
The command is used to know what exactly were the changes, and not just the files where you made the changes.
``` git diff``` shows you the exact lines added and removed- the patch, as they were. The command basically answers two questions - What changes are yet to be staged ( use ``` git diff ```) ? and What staged changes are yet to get committed ?( use ```git diff --staged```) <br>
Suppose you have two files, ```readme.txt``` and ```demo.txt```, and you've staged readme but not contr, you get the following response -
